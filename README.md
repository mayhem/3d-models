3d-models
=========

This is my collection of 3D models. Some things are not going to be useful to anyone but me. Some
might be quite useful. You decide!

Things that I think might be useful:

* coffee_plate.scad: An adapter plate for the Aeropress and other coffee filters for large mugs
* stand-offs.scad: Stand-offs for use in electronics. Make a grid of them with your desired dimentions.
